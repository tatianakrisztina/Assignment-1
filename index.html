        Countries around the world have been handling the COVID-19 pandemic differently. There are different rules, different laws in place around the world. From social distancing to mandatory mask requirements and vaccine mandates.</p>

  <p>But there’s a difference between having rules in place and following those rules. And various citizens have different views on how their country has been following the rules. </p>

  <p>The World Happiness Report asked people around the world if they think others in their country are following their country’s guidelines.</p>

  <p>Some data correlates well - like how 80% of people in China believe their fellow countrymen have been following the COVID guidelines and they have the lowest deaths per million rate at 3.47 deaths per million. However, the country with the lowest faith in people following the rules, Mexico at 30%, doesn’t have the highest deaths per million rate. Mexico averages at 2,171 deaths per million, while the highest is Italy at 2,710 deaths per million. Italy averages at 51% of people believing the country follows the rules.</p>

  <p>At home in the United States, only 47% of people believe others are following the guidelines.
